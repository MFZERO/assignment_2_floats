		<h2>Players to watch as trade deadline approaches</h2>

		<h3> Steven Stamkos, Tampa Bay Lightning</h3> <img src= "stamkos.png" alt="stamkos"/>
		<p>He's the most intriguing trade prospect in a long time, maybe ever. Stamkos, who can be an unrestricted free agent after the season, has said he wants to stay with the Lightning. But the longer he goes without a new contract the better the chance he will be traded. The Lightning can't risk letting Stamkos walk in the offseason without getting anything of value in return.</p>
<p> There are so many variables to Stamkos' situation, particularly because he has a no-trade clause in his current contract.</p>

<p>Do the Lightning want to re-sign him? Can they afford to trade him if they make a push up the standings between now and the deadline? Where would Stamkos want to go? Does he even want to go anywhere in the middle of the season? Are the Toronto Maple Leafs, his hometown team, willing to trade assets for him, or wait until July 1 when all they need to get him is money?</p>

<p>There is more than enough drama in the Stamkos story to keep everyone interested. What makes it even better is where the Lightning will be on trade deadline day: Toronto. </p>
	<h3>Travis Hamonic, New York Islanders</h3> <img src="hamonic.png" alt="hamonic"/>

<p>Hamonic has requested a trade for personal reasons that have to do with his family. He is from St. Malo, Manitoba, about an hour drive south from Winnipeg.</p>

<p>Islanders coach Jack Capuano said in November, when Hamonic's trade request became public, that he has known about the defenseman's situation for several months. The fact the Islanders haven't traded him yet suggests they haven't found the right partner and terms.</p>

<p>Then again, trading Hamonic can't be easy for Islanders general manager Garth Snow, especially because defenseman Johnny Boychuk will be out 4-6 weeks with an upper-body injury sustained Dec. 31. The Islanders need Hamonic now more than ever to stay in the race in the Metropolitan Division.</p>

<p>Hamonic is an all-situation defenseman who leads the Islanders in ice time at 23:53 per game and is signed for four more seasons with an extremely reasonable salary cap charge of $3.857 million, according to war-on-ice.com. </p>
